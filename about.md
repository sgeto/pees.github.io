I'm Matias Fontanini, a Software Engineer from Argentina. I'm currently working at
[ThousandEyes](https://www.thousandeyes.com/) where I develop tools to measure network 
properties by crafting, sending and receiving packets, implement some outage detection 
systems and some random other work.

_C++_ is my main programming language. I like template metaprogramming and try to stay up to
date with the new standard releases. Python is my goto language whenever I need to automate
some tedious task or need to write something quickly.

In the past, I've worked on security, mostly network security and penetration testing. I like 
staring at code and find issues and ways to exploit it.

## Projects

The main projects I've worked on are:

* [libtins](https://github.com/mfontanini/libtins): a fast C++ packet crafting and sniffing
library.
* [cppkafka](https://github.com/mfontanini/cppkafka): a C++11 wrapper for _librdkafka_.
* [dot11decrypt](https://github.com/mfontanini/dot11decrypt): A tiny tool that mostly relies
on _libtins_ WEP/WPA2 decryption capabilities to perform on the fly decryption of 802.11
encrypted frames.
* I also have a repository that contains 
[random scripts and stuff](https://github.com/mfontanini/Programs-Scripts) that I've worked on
and didn't really deserve their own repo (or at least I that's what I thought at the time).

## Blog

I used to post stuff in [my blog](http://average-coder.blogspot.com/) but I've decided to
only write here now.
